# A-Glimpse-of-the-Olympics-History-via-Visuals

## Summary
The reason I chose this dataset is because the Olympics history has a lot of stories to tell. Through the history of Olympics we can peek some historical trends of whole human society, too. 
The columns I focused on are the "Sex", "Weight", "Height", "NOC", "Sport", "Year" and "Medal". Several plots are based on these variables and generate interesting history insights.
The python modules utilized in the project includes: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, StatsModels, etc.
