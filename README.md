# A-Glimpse-of-the-Olympics-History-via-Visuals


The dataset records the athletes, events and results information from 120 years of Olympic history: from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. See: https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/home

## Summary
-  The reason I chose this dataset is because the Olympics history has a lot of stories to tell. Through the history of Olympics we can peek some historical trends of whole human society, too. 
-  The columns I focused on are the "Sex", "Weight", "Height", "NOC", "Sport", "Year" and "Medal". Several plots are based on these variables and generate interesting history insights.
-  The python modules utilized in the project includes: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, StatsModels, etc.

Nothing compares to the line graph when revealing some certain trends. So here the line graph is used to give a quick look how number of athletes changed since the first Olympics.

We can see the 1948 Olympics was mainly a Western Country festival.

While the USA being no doubt the only "Superpower" in medals, all other countries in the Top 10 are european countries.

The USA dominates Athletics and Swimming with gold medal numbers way more than silver or bronze. Other sports of the USA seem to lack the overwhelming power of these two sports. One reason might be Athletics and Swimming being two of the sports have the larget numbers of events.
