# A-Glimpse-of-the-Olympics-History-via-Visuals

## Summary
-  The reason I chose this dataset is because the Olympics history has a lot of stories to tell. Through the history of Olympics we can peek some historical trends of whole human society, too. 
-  The columns I focused on are the "Sex", "Weight", "Height", "NOC", "Sport", "Year" and "Medal". Several plots are based on these variables and generate interesting history insights.
-  The python modules utilized in the project includes: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, StatsModels, etc.

Nothing compares to the line graph when revealing some certain trends. So here the line graph is used to give a quick look how number of athletes changed since the first Olympics.

While the USA being no doubt the only "Superpower" in medals, all other countries in the Top 10 are european countries.

Still the USA being the only top-tier competitors in medals. But this time, Asian countries and Russia earned significant positions in the chart. That also indicates the involvement of the Olympic Games improved during the years.

The USA dominates Athletics and Swimming with gold medal numbers way more than silver or bronze. Other sports of the USA seem to lack the overwhelming power of these two sports. One reason might be Athletics and Swimming being two of the sports have the larget numbers of events.
