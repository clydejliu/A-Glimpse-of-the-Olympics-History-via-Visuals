# A-Glimpse-of-the-Olympics-History-via-Visuals

## Summary
-  The reason I chose this dataset is because the Olympics history has a lot of stories to tell. Through the history of Olympics we can peek some historical trends of whole human society, too. 
-  The columns I focused on are the "Sex", "Weight", "Height", "NOC", "Sport", "Year" and "Medal". Several plots are based on these variables and generate interesting history insights.
-  The python modules utilized in the project includes: Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib, StatsModels, etc.

-  First, in 1906 a "Intercalated Games" was held and seen as a compromise between the Greeks and Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the International Olympic Committee. This was the first and last "Intercalated Games" that was scheduled in between every offcial Summer Olympics. 
-  Second, there are multiple "missing years" during the first half of 20th centure due to WWI and WWII.
-  Third, the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics had a decline in male athletes number due to the Great Depression. And Los Angeles was far away from that time's center of the World, the Europe. It's the same when 1956 Melbourne Olympics was first held in the Oceania far away from other parts of the world. In 1980 the Soviet Union just invaded Afghanistan so many western countries refused to attend the Moscow Olympics.
-  Fourth, the growing population of female Olympics atheletes witnessed the rise of women in sports as well as in other aspects.

While the USA being no doubt the only "Superpower" in medals, all other countries in the Top 10 are european countries.

Still the USA being the only top-tier competitors in medals. But this time, Asian countries and Russia earned significant positions in the chart. That also indicates the involvement of the Olympic Games improved during the years.

The USA dominates Athletics and Swimming with gold medal numbers way more than silver or bronze. Other sports of the USA seem to lack the overwhelming power of these two sports. One reason might be Athletics and Swimming being two of the sports have the larget numbers of events.
